# PyTorch Notebooks  

This repository documents my learning journey with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).  
It contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that progressively introduce fundamental concepts, experiments, and small projects.  

## Lecture Summaries  

- **Lecture 03**  
  *Topic: FashionMNIST classification*  
  - Implemented two models on the FashionMNIST dataset:  
    - A fully connected non-linear model.  
    - A convolutional neural network (CNN) for improved performance on image data.  

- **Lecture 02**  
  *Topic: Non-linear models with ReLU activations*  
  - Trained a model on the `make_circles` dataset.  
  - Extended the approach to the `make_moons` dataset.  

- **Lecture 01**  
  *Topic: First PyTorch model*  
  - Built and trained a simple linear regression model for predicting linear data.  

- **Lecture 00**  
  *Topic: PyTorch syntax and tensors*  
  - Practiced basic PyTorch syntax.  
  - Explored fundamental tensor operations.
